    "text": "I am currently a senior data scientist at Walmart Connect. Prior to working at Walmart Connect, I worked for four years at Callisto Media Inc., a data-driven book publishing start-up, up until its sale to Penguin Random House in May 2023. Before Callisto, I was a PhD Student in Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley, where I conducted research on political misinformation, political contributor networks, and “small world” network structures.\nI have spent the majority of my career working on a small team, which has made me a data science generalist. I have practical experience working with business stakeholders and leading a data science team as well as technical experience in time series forecasting using econometric and supervised machine learning methods, automating online advertising bid optimization using Bayesian methods, and text clustering using unsupervised machine learning.\nIn my free time I enjoy playing chess, watching Ohio State football, camping, and hiking with my wife, Samantha, around where we live in Southern California."
