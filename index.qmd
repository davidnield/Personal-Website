I am a Data Scientist at Callisto Media, a data-driven book publishing company, where I have worked since 2019.

I work on a small team which means that I am a generalist. I have experience building time series forecasting models for inventory and demand forecasting, designing A/B tests and Bayesian bid optimization algorithms for online advertising, and using word embeddings to cluster customer search terms into topics useful for identifying new product opportunities.

When I am not working, I am playing Chess, watching Ohio State football and Lakers basketball, or hiking with my wife, Samantha, around where we live in Southern California.

In May 2023, Callisto Media was acquired by Penguin Random House, where I am currently temporarily employed until August 2023. I am looking for a new data science role, either remote or hybrid/in-office in Southern California. A pdf version of my resume can be found in the navigation bar on the top left of this page. Please feel free to reach out via e-mail using the "Contact me" icon at the bottom of the page.
