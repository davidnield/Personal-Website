I am a Data Scientist at Callisto Media, a data-driven book publishing company, where I have worked since 2019.

I work on a small team which means that I am a generalist. I have experience building time series forecasting models for inventory and demand forecasting, designing A/B tests and Bayesian bid optimization algorithms for online advertising, and using word embeddings to cluster customer search terms into topics useful for identifying new product opportunities.

When I am not working, I enjoy playing Chess, watching Ohio State football and Lakers basketball, and going on hikes with my wife, Samantha, around where we live in Southern California.

In May 2023, Callisto Media was acquired by Penguin Random House. I am currently under contract to Penguin Random House until August 2023. I am currently looking for new opportunities to start in August or September 2023. A pdf version of my resume can be found in the top left of the navigation bar and please feel free to reach out via e-mail using the mail icon at the bottom of the page.
