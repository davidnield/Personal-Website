I have experience building time series forecasting models for inventory and demand forecasting, designing A/B tests and Bayesian bid optimization algorithms for online advertising, and using word embeddings to cluster customer search terms into topics useful for identifying new product opportunities.\nWhen I am not working, I am playing Chess, watching Ohio State football and Lakers basketball, or hiking with my wife, Samantha, around where we live in Southern California.\nIn May 2023, Callisto Media was acquired by Penguin Random House where I am currently under contract until August 2023. I am currently looking for new opportunities to start after my contract ends.
